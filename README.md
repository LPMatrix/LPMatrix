### Since you are here, I'll tell you about myself 👋

I am a software engineer with a passion for solving complex problems and building efficient and scalable systems. My skillset includes PHP and Python, and I have a solid foundation in fundamental computing concepts such as networking, databases, concurrency, parallelism, locking, algorithms, data structures, performance monitoring, and optimization.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in and contributing to open source projects, as I believe in the power of collaboration and sharing knowledge to drive innovation.

Thank you for visiting my profile. I am always open to new opportunities and challenges, so please don't hesitate to reach out.
